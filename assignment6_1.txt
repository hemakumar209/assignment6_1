c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status?

      >job<-as.numeric(data$job)
      >marital<-as.numeric(data$marital)
      >cor(job,marital) 
      [1] 0.06939026     #
    
       >bartable = table(data$job, data$marital)  
       >barplot(bartable, beside = TRUE, legend =levels(unique(data$job)))

d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?
   Ans:
      >job<-as.numeric(data$job)
      >education<-as.numeric(data$education)
      >cor(job,education) 
      [1] 0.1701602    #
                    

      >bartable = table(data$job, data$education)  
      >barplot(bartable, beside = TRUE, legend =levels(unique(data$job)))

   #employe with primary education are mostly placed in blue-collar job
    secondary education are placed in different jobs and tertiary aer mostly placed in 
    managment and unknown are placed in less jobs
